# slide-responsively
WordPress "slide-responsively" plugin.    Inspired by the "sliding-door" theme ( https://wordpress.org/themes/sliding-door/ ) but this is instead a *&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive&lt;/a>* version, and a *plugin* instead, that allows you to freely use another theme entirely ( eg: the nicely responsive "&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/">twenty fifteen&lt;/a>" theme from the fine folks at WordPress )
