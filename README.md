# slide-responsively
WordPress "slide-responsively" plugin.    

Inspired by the "sliding-door" theme ( https://wordpress.org/themes/sliding-door/ ).

but this is instead a *responsive http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design* version, and a *plugin* instead.

This allows you to freely use another WordPress theme entirely ( eg: the nicely responsive Twenty Fifteen https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/ theme from the fine folks at WordPress )

Lastly, I changed my plugin to use CSS animations (instead of JS animations like the theme used) for smoother sliding animations
(since it uses browser core animation and doesn't tie up / succumb to JS interrupts).
